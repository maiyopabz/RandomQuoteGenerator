# RandomQuoteGenerator

`Javascript` , `HTML` , and `CSS`.

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description 

I declared an arrays that is called `quotes` that holds 5 objects with each properties and values.
Then I created a `getRandomQuote` function that generates a number from index value of 0 to length of the qoutes array that has been declared. This will also returns a randomize object within the qoutes array object.

I declared a `printQuote` function that calls the getRandomQuote() function then generates its value to print the html into the html page.

I declared a conditional statement that holds and compare properties values to the empty variable that I declared called `emptyVariable`. 

I also used string interpolation, template literals to print and evaluate when the conditon is true or false.

 I create a function called getrandomcolor so that when the button is generated the color also changes.

Then for extra credit I set a setInterval() method that calls a function at a specified interval which I set to 6seconds. This will automatic refresh the page every 6seconds and the output will display a fresh new qoute and color everytime.
